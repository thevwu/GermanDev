Entirety of the Drupal site I designed for a client.  It is fully responsive and should size accordingly to your browser size and computer type.  Client had specific design and color choices he requested.  

The college this was made for decided to push their own implementation of Drupal downwards, and as a result my implementation was scrapped and never used.  

Particular code trees of interest:


root -> profiles -> julio is where most of the development took place


root -> profiles -> julio -> themes -> watt -> styles -> style.css is where most of the CSS development was made.  You can find the majority of the code responsible for responsive layouts there.
